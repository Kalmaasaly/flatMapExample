## Introduction

This project showcases how to use streams in Java to process a collection of books and their chapters. It provides examples of generating dummy books and chapters, and demonstrates how to use stream operations to print book IDs and chapter titles.

## Technologies

The project is implemented in Java and utilizes the following technologies:

- Maven: A build automation tool used for managing dependencies and building the project.
- Java Streams: A feature introduced in Java 8 that provides a functional programming approach for processing collections of data.

## Installation

To run this project locally, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
- Apache Maven

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repository`
3. Compile the project: `mvn compile`
4. Run the Main class: `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"`

## Usage

The `Main` class contains the entry point for the project. It generates dummy books and chapters, and processes them using Java streams. The book IDs and chapter titles are printed to the console.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the project:

```java
List<Book> books = generateDummyBooks(10);
System.out.println("books size::" + books.size());

books.stream()
        .peek(book -> System.out.println("Book ID: " + book.getId()))
        .flatMap(t -> t.getChapters().stream())
        .peek(chapter -> System.out.println("Chapter Title: " + chapter.getId()))
        .forEach(c -> {});

This code snippet generates 10 dummy books, prints the number of books, and then processes the books using streams to print the book IDs and chapter titles.
